## Her Journey: From Athlete to Holistic Coach

### Athletic Background
- **Former D1 College Track Athlete** at a competitive collegiate level
- Lived and breathed performance-driven training during her athletic career
- Developed a deep understanding of discipline, dedication, and pushing physical limits

### The Breaking Point
After her structured athletic career ended, Paige's relationship with fitness and her body became complicated:

- **Experienced extreme weight fluctuations** - cycling through highs and lows without understanding why
- **Suffered through injuries** that tested her physical and mental resilience  
- **Battled hormonal imbalances** that no conventional fitness approach seemed to address
- **Hit frustrating fitness plateaus** despite her athletic background and determination
- **Struggled for nearly 4 years** with overtraining, under-eating, and constant self-criticism
- Felt betrayed by her own body and confused about how to regain control

### The Transformation
Paige's turning point came when she realized she wasn't fighting laziness or lack of discipline—she was fighting her own biology. This revelation led her to:

- Study functional nutrition, hormone health, and women-specific fitness approaches
- Earn professional certifications in personal training, functional nutrition, and hormone health
- Completely rebuild her relationship with fitness and her body from the ground up
- Discover how to work WITH her hormones instead of against them
- Create sustainable approaches that honored her body's unique needs

### The Mission Born from Struggle
Through her personal journey of healing and transformation, Paige developed a profound understanding:

> **Women deserve better than generic fitness programs designed for men's bodies. We deserve approaches that honor our hormones, our life demands, and our desire for balance.**

This belief became the foundation for Viora.

## The Viora Philosophy: Balance Over Extremes

### Core Beliefs

**1. Personalization Over Prescription**
Every woman's body, hormones, and life circumstances are unique. Cookie-cutter programs ignore this reality. Paige believes in creating fully customized approaches tailored to each client's specific needs, goals, and lifestyle.

**2. Hormone-Aware Training**
Women's bodies operate on a 28-day hormonal cycle, not a 24-hour cycle like men. Effective fitness programming must account for these natural fluctuations in energy, strength, and recovery needs.

**3. Sustainable Over Extreme**
Quick fixes and extreme measures might produce short-term results, but they're impossible to maintain. Paige focuses on creating habits and approaches that women can sustain for life—not just for a 12-week challenge.

**4. Nourishment Over Restriction**
Food is fuel, not the enemy. Rather than eliminating foods or following rigid meal plans, Paige teaches women how to nourish their bodies in ways that support their goals, hormones, and social lives.

**5. Empowerment Through Education**
Paige doesn't want clients who depend on her forever. She educates women to understand their own bodies, make informed decisions, and eventually coach themselves with confidence.

**6. Whole-Self Transformation**
True transformation extends beyond physical changes. It encompasses mindset, confidence, energy levels, hormone balance, sleep quality, stress management, and overall life satisfaction.

## The Viora Method: Three-Pillar Approach

Paige developed The Viora Method based on her personal journey and professional experience working with hundreds of women:

### Pillar 1: Empowered Movement
**Custom strength training designed for individual bodies, goals, and hormone cycles**

- Personalized training programs based on fitness level and equipment access
- Hormone-optimized programming that adapts to menstrual cycle phases
- Progressive overload strategies for building strength without burnout
- Form coaching and video reviews for safe, effective training
- Flexible scheduling (3-5 workouts per week) that fits real life

**The Result:** Build real strength and confidence without depleting yourself—workouts that energize you, not exhaust you.

### Pillar 2: Nourishing Nutrition
**Sustainable eating strategies that fuel your body without restriction or deprivation**

- Personalized macronutrient targets based on body composition and goals
- Flexible meal frameworks (not rigid meal plans) that teach HOW to eat
- Hormone-supporting nutrition protocols to optimize balance
- Social life integration—enjoy meals with friends without guilt
- Metabolism education for long-term understanding

**The Result:** Fuel your body effectively while enjoying food—no more restriction, guilt, or yo-yo dieting.

### Pillar 3: Whole-Self Wellness
**Mindset coaching, hormone education, and lifestyle strategies for complete transformation**

- Mindset coaching to overcome mental blocks and build confidence
- Hormone health education to understand your cycle and optimize rhythms
- Stress management strategies (because cortisol affects everything)
- Sleep optimization guidance (recovery happens when you rest)
- Lifestyle integration to make fitness work WITH your busy life

**The Result:** Transformation that extends far beyond the gym—into how you feel, think, and move through the world.

## Paige's Coaching Philosophy

### Partnership Over Prescription
Paige doesn't believe in handing clients a generic plan and hoping they stick to it. Instead, she creates true partnerships where:

- Clients are actively involved in program design and adjustments
- Communication flows both ways with regular check-ins and feedback
- Programs evolve based on progress, challenges, and life changes
- Education is prioritized so clients understand the "why" behind every recommendation
- Success is celebrated together, and obstacles are navigated as a team

### The Human-First Approach
Paige recognizes that her clients are complete human beings with:

- Demanding careers and professional ambitions
- Family responsibilities and relationships
- Social lives they want to enjoy
- Travel plans and special occasions
- Stress, emotions, and real-life challenges
- Bad days, hormonal fluctuations, and unpredictable schedules

Her coaching adapts to these realities rather than ignoring them.

### Progress Over Perfection
Paige believes that:

- Consistency beats intensity every time
- Imperfect action is better than perfect inaction
- Missing a workout or having an indulgent meal doesn't erase progress
- Sustainable transformation happens through small, repeated actions
- Flexibility and self-compassion are essential for long-term success

## What Sets Paige Apart

### 1. Lived Experience + Professional Expertise
Paige doesn't just have certifications—she has walked the exact path her clients are on. She understands the frustration, confusion, and emotional toll of struggling with fitness and hormones because she lived it for years. This combination of personal experience and professional training creates a unique depth of understanding and empathy.

### 2. Hormone-First Approach
While many trainers ignore or minimize the impact of hormones on women's fitness, Paige puts hormone health at the center of her methodology. She understands that no amount of training or nutrition can overcome hormonal imbalances, and she designs programs that support rather than disrupt hormone balance.

### 3. True Personalization
Paige doesn't believe in tiered packages where everyone at a level gets the same program. Every single client receives fully customized programming based on their unique body, goals, lifestyle, hormone patterns, and preferences.

### 4. Sustainable, Anti-Diet Philosophy
In an industry obsessed with transformation challenges and before/after photos, Paige focuses on creating approaches that women can maintain for life. She explicitly rejects diet culture, restriction mentality, and unsustainable practices.

### 5. Education-Centered Coaching
Paige's ultimate goal is to make herself unnecessary. She wants clients to become so knowledgeable about their own bodies that they can eventually coach themselves with confidence.

### 6. Whole-Person Integration
Paige recognizes that fitness doesn't exist in a vacuum. She considers her clients' careers, relationships, stress levels, sleep patterns, mental health, and life circumstances when designing their programs.
