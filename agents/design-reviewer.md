3. **Cards & Accordions:**
   - Philosophy cards flip on hover (desktop) or click (mobile)
   - Method accordion expands/collapses smoothly
   - Only one accordion item open at a time

4. **Testimonials:**
   - Filter buttons work correctly
   - Cards have hover lift effect

   - Modal closes on X click, ESC key, or backdrop click

### Step 4: Responsive Testing

### Step 6: Technical Validation

3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Verify no layout shift (CLS issues)
5. Check image loading (lazy load working)

### Step 7: Brand Voice & Content

Evaluate content presentation:
